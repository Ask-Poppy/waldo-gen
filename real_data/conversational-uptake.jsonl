So we still get 56, but now, well done, Student J, the decimal has to be moved over two places, one, two, and now it reads 56 hundredths.  Can you show me what 56 hundredths looks like? Remember, Student T, we have to change it from five and six- tenths because I put the decimal in the wrong place, to 56 hundredths.  Student T, same thing.  We made an error here because I wrote the decimal wrong.  Which is a good point, because it just goes to show you that depending on how many places you have behind a decimal will change your answer. Because five and six-tenths and 56 hundredths are going to give you two totally different answers.  But this is the answer that we're looking for, right here.

We are going to check our work with two different strategies. And if this is the strategy that you're using, you're going to make sure that you put the pieces back together.  That's what over here  and the only thing, Student E, I wish that you would do is this, what I did here.  Show me that you have all your pieces. So just to let you know, we've been working in three groups.  I'm gonna put some challenge problems up here.  The challenge people are going to be working on their own, okay?  The challenge is completely voluntary.  You just feel like doing it. But in the challenge group, everybody has to show me the array that represents their numbers, okay?  Because that's another problem.  People are missing of the problem, of the multiplication problem.  So I'm gonna say  and the group that I've been working with, the one at the back table, I'm gonna work with you, and we're gonna work right up here, all right? So we're not moving.  We do have to trade places.  Like you two can work at the round table, and you're gonna have your own problems, all right.

It's the exact same thing, and the reason is, for right now, until you are accurate, once you're being accurate all the time, we can drop it away, okay?  But until we're accurate, you're gonna use it to help you. I'm a little  what I'm gonna suggest, I'm gonna give you a multiplication "}, {"role": "user", "content": "I did it the wrong way.

I think your multiplication, Student D, is actually very good.  It's you cram it all together, and then you can't see things.  So I think you need to  actually, make your array larger so you really can write your numbers. It's brilliant.  I don't think your problem is really the math.  It's sort of like your organization.  I think you drive yourself crazy that way."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yes, the same answer two times."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Can I take yours?

Am I understanding this correctly?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "She broke the 60 and the 35, so she put 60 times 30, and it equals 180  1,080."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay.

I wanna see if she has all "}, {"role": "user", "content": "[As soon as] she puts 300, two times."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay, so this, Student N, about trying to keep track of your pieces.  In the array here, I'm gonna see if I can do it. Thirty and five, is that how you broke things up?  I think I see a 30, and I see the 5.  I think I see the 60 and the 4.  Am I okay?  Sixty and four.  I think that's the only way you broke your numbers up, right? And you multiplies the 60 times the 30.

I think I'm going to break my 60  I'm gonna keep my 64 whole, and I'm gonna break up the 35.\"  You wanna know how they broke it up?  It's the way you used to always do it.

How do scientists use lines?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Why do they call them blueprints?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Because the paper is blue.  Before they had computers and you could just print things off, they would have to have paper that allowed you to trace, and it would print by tracing onto a separate piece of paper.  So the paper is actually blue originally, talking about when they first started, it was blue. Now so many things are computerized that they don't often use blueprints anymore.  But on page 216, let's take a look at that."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Latitude and longitude.  Sometimes you use a world globe or a flat map to locate countries, cities, rivers and so forth.

We're gonna focus on that."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Parallels because each one is a circle that is parallel to the equator."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "So let's stop right there.  Take a look at the map in the middle of the page there.  If you see where the equator is, raise your hand.  Raise your hand if you see the equator on the map in the middle of that page.  So the equator is running from east to west, from left to right.  If you take a look at the line right above that and it says 15 degrees north, would you raise your hand if you see that?  Okay. That is called a parallel line of latitude.  Why can tell me why, based on what we've covered the last couple of day, why that's considered a parallel line of latitude?  Student M."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Because it's parallel to the equator."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Exactly and we've covered that before.  So that line 15 degrees north is parallel to the equator.  Does everybody see that?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Lines of latitude are measured in degrees.  Lines north of the equator are labeled and lines south of the equator are labeled as "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "So let's back up and let's read that correctly.

The area north of the equator is called the north hemisphere."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "North hemisphere."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The area south of the equator is called the southern hemisphere."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay, stop right there.  So when we take a look at our map we see the equator.  Anything north of the equator is called the northern hemisphere.  Anything south is called the southern hemisphere.  The equator divides the north from the south, in other words. Student G did a good job of reading here in terms of degrees, south degrees, north.  We see the numbers associated with those degrees.  That lets us know  why would that be important to know the numbers of degrees north or degrees south?

You might use a GPS, some kind of navigation system.  But would this north and south of the equator information be good for people traveling by car, by boat? Does it matter?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "I think because near the center of the earth it's hotter."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "But why is it hotter?  You are right.  Both of you are right. The center of the earth is hotter.  But why?  Hands.  Sit down, Student A.  You're out of your seat almost. Can you help us out with that, Student S?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "I think, well, I think the only reason why it says that is because you said that because of  we're still talking about how hot or cold it is between latitude, right?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "You tell us.  Have you been listening?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Because there's magma in the center of the earth, so the closer to the magma you are the hotter it is."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Not quite, because there will be magma even in North America or even Central Europe. You guys are thinking really logically, and your answer I think is probably similar to what Student M might have been thinking or, I'm not quite sure, but maybe even Student M's."}, {"role": "user", "content": "If you're closer to the sun, then the sun gets more heat onto it and that's why it's hotter."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay, that's added.  Actually, the earth is tilted a little bit. It's still going to be tilted.  It's still gonna be rotating, but the sun's rays themselves, where the earth is positioned, most of the heat is gonna be the center part as opposed to the poles, and it makes a big difference even in a few degrees north or south latitude.  It makes a difference in terms of how warm it is on earth.  What do you think?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Who's gonna be reading?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Student T."}, {"role": "user", "content": "I'm gonna go with the International Dateline."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The International Dateline.

I'd say likely because I remember it snowing in January usually at least one time.  It didn't mean that it was a snowstorm, but we could see a little bit of snow in January.  So I would have probably put likely. But if you put maybe and you're thinking like Student B or Teacher G, like, oh, sometimes it does, sometimes it doesn't, then that's where you would have put maybe.  I'm still leaning towards likely.  You know why I'm thinking that?  Because I'm a skier, and I am always paying attention to when that snow's coming.  And I remember January being a month when usually I'm waiting for one snow.  Come on, it's going to snow one time.  And it snows one time, at least one time.

I told you yesterday, I think this stuff is a little beneath our class, quite frankly, but they show up on the CRCT, and I don't want it to be a case where it's an easy problem and you're sitting there unsure of how to do it.

I don't know if that's a good way to say it or not, but you know it's 9, right, and Student C's looking at it and saying there's 9 blocks here.  I see that.

Do I need another group?  Do you guys need more time?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "I just thought of a different way to do it.

You can't add until you've made them all sixes.  You have one third here. 3 times what is 6?  Do 2 over 2.  1 times 2, 2. This one times what is going to equal 6?  3 over 3. 1 times 3 is 3.  Now you can add them together because you made them all the same.  Add your wholes first.  Okay.  Now add your numerators only.  We did. I just left it because it's already 6.  You don't have to change it.  You make these match up to this one.  This is improper though, so we need to divide it, and make your mixed number out of this, then add it to that, and you're good.  Okay.  You can't have two fifths.  You can't add denominators like that. So you have to change it to make them.  Do you have anything with sixes?  How many triangles do you have? You have to make these two be equivalent to each other.  What is a multiple of two and three?  Say the multiples.  Multiples, 2, 4, 6, 8.  My multiples of 3.  Make them both to 6.  2 times 3.  It's three sixths.  This times 2.  Make it equivalent.  Now you can add them together.  10, 11, 12, 13.  3 plus 2. Okay.  So you have thirteen and five sixths is what you have.  Okay.

Oh, the timer must have been running when I pulled it up initially this morning, but you got it pretty quick.  You did it pretty quick.  So if you want to try your hand at 4 by 4, Student K, I will print some out for later. Now that our brains are all warm, we are going to start our lesson for today.  Student M, can you flick that first light on for me?  We've been spending quite a bit of time over these last two weeks talking about fractions.  We've simplified fractions.  We've made equivalent fractions.  We've added and subtracted fractions, oh, and we've multiplied fractions too.  You're probably sick of fractions. They're probably coming to of your ears, but there are still more things we can do with fractions.  We still have to learn how to divide the fractions, and today we're going to look at how fractions and decimals relate.  How do fractions and decimals relate, Student N?  Your essential question is how do fractions and decimals relate?  Turn to a clean page in your math journal, and write that down.  Okay. Now raise your hand if you like money.  I knew it, everybody.  So Ms. L is going to give you one whiteboard dollar.  Fantastic.  Who can tell me how we write this?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "It's in simplest form."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The fraction bar is in simplest form?  I don't remember saying that.  Student R?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The fraction bar is the same thing as a division sign."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Do we remember that?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Because it's already a dollar."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "You're on the right track but I need some more.  Dig deep inside those math brains.  Student M?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Because the 0, it makes the 1 still the same value."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It does, but when we put that 0 there before, when Student E told me to, it changed the value of the 1 to 10.  But then Student J said add the decimal, and I was like, okay, that's better, because now the value of that 1 is still 1, a dollar.  But why does that work?  What is so magical?  What happened?  Student J?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "With the decimal it gets smaller and without the decimal it gets bigger."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "That is true, but why?  Why does this work?  Student R?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Because you always have to put the 0 with the 10, and you just have to put a decimal in the back, which is a whole number."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Right.  When you add this decimal, it helps you keep your value.  We can add a million zeros behind this decimal, and it's still going to equal 1, but without this decimal it's no longer 1.  It's 10.  If you add two zeros, it's 100.  That decimal helps you keep your whole number value because everything after this is going to be smaller than 1.  Now we got this set up.  Who can tell me what to do?  Remember, we're trying to see how one fourth equals twenty-five hundredths.  We got it set up.  We figured out we needed to add that decimal there to keep our value at 1 but to still be able to divide.  What's the next step?  Student L?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "You multiply.  You divide 1 by 4."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "What do we get?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "4 into 20 goes 5 times."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Then what?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "You multiply 5 by 4."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "And I get what?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "30.  I just said it.  30"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Think about it.  6 times 4 is 24.  How can you find out what 7 times 4 is?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "28.  It's 28.  So right here I put 7?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Then I put 28 here."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Mm-hmm."}, {"role": "user", "content": "First I eliminated C and A because C was too high and A was too low, then I divided to check my answer."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay.  Can you tell us one more time?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "First I eliminated C and A because C was too high and A was too low, then I divided and checked my answer."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay.  So Student J looked at the answer choices first and was like, A is going to be too low.  She used her background knowledge to decide that.  Then she said C is going to be too high, because look.  You have a whole number right here.  Is this fraction a whole number?"}]}

I need you to write 10 times 10.  Then it's Student P's turn, okay?  Okay. It's not 100 times 10.  It's 100, then leave a little space and do 10 times 10 so we know these are two separate situations.  Oh no.  You need to remember to record each others."}]}

Now 90 isn't super close to 80, is it?  But we can do that easily in our head, right? We can do 90 divided by 3 so easily in our head that we don't even realize how easily we can do it.  90 divided by 3, we ignore the 0.  We know 9 divided by 3 is 3, and how many zeros are there?  One zero.  So my estimated quotient is 30.  So my actual answer is going to be close to 30.  So is my actual answer going to be higher or lower than 30?  Student J, thanks for raising your hand."}]}

Student A, start writing, doing the math.  Did you already do it, Student M?  Where is it?  No, where did you do the subtraction?  I'm coming around.  We're not waiting for someone else to come up with it.  You do the math.  Student M, what do you think?  It may be confusing to her.  It doesn't mean it has to be confusing to you, Student J.

So you were kind of  to recap what you said a little bit, you're suggesting that because I left 2 here instead of just 1, that told you this would be more?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The denominator tells us how many there are in each rectangle, how much it says on the rectangle."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Student J, okay.  Can I recap what you said a little bit?  Did you mean the denominator down here, that tells you how many there are.  So can I do  for example, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 10.  Does that work?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "It means how many equal groups are there."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It means how many equal groups we have, yes?  Yeah.  Okay.  So if I have 10 equal groups, think of this as  if I have 10 people to share with, or 11 people to share with, and I have the same amount.  I have a candy bar that's this large, and a second candy bar the same size.  I'm going to either share it with 10 people or 11 people.  Which pieces are going to be larger, sharing with 10 or sharing with 11?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Just start with one box."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I can't because they need to be the  these need to be the same size.  It's hard doing elevenths because it isn't an even number.  So let's see.  5, 9, 10, 11.  There we go.  I've got 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. There we go.  It's not very precise but it will work. When we get ready to do our work at the tables, you'll have your fractions that are more exact.  So let's just see, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.  Now granted these are not very precise fractions of my bar here, but take a look.  Can you see that 9 of the smaller pieces, the elevenths, are not quite as much as 9 of the tenths, because the tenths are a little bit larger.  If it's a candy bar, I'd rather have nine tenths than nine elevenths. This one's definitely larger.  Let's move along so we can get to our group time.  On geometry  just a second, sweetheart.  On the geometry, it said to draw a rectangular prism.  How many faces does it have? Student J, how many faces does a rectangular prism have?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have to add it."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "You have to add what?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "They're the same centimeters.

Check your answers.  683,503.  Okay. Then for the pattern down below, 70, 84, 98.  Put your total down at the bottom.  That took a lot longer than we normally do.  All right.

We have Student B, Student E, Student Z, Student D, and Student M.  You don't need the marker, just your fractions kit.  You know what?  I didn't bring my fractions kit.  Ms. C came unprepared.

They didn't go as high as that. That might be higher, I don't remember.  But you've got your multiples there too. All right, here's what I want you to do.  I want you to take about a minute to do something for me, and you're going to give it to me, because I'm going to see if you got the pattern thing down, and then we'll start testing and see how you're going to do. Everybody's going to get one notecard, and as you go back to your seat and put your calendar in your blue math folder, take one note card, put your name on it.  Come to me right here if you're going back to your seat.  Stay at your seats if you're at your seats.  Put your name on the notecard and then wait for your directions.  Put your name anywhere, it doesn't matter to me.  You just put your name on it.  Put your calendars, slide them away, because we only have one more week. Here's what I want you to do before we get started, girls and guys. I collect these from you.  We're going to put them on the board for some pattern work.  Take your pencil.  Name on the card, Student D.  Here's what I want you to do.  And take about 30 seconds to a minute.  I want you to put on the card  just for me and for our classmates  do you need one, Student J, grab up there. All right, I'd like for you to come up with a pattern using numbers or shapes, symbols, whatever you'd like to use.  Have some type of repeat, because otherwise we can't tell what it is, and then leave the last three blank, because we're going to see if we can guess what your pattern is. Now, you can use numbers, if you want, but don't use something really simple.  Like if you go 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and then blank, blank, Well, somebody knows, 30, 35, 40.  You can make it a little harder than that. Or let's say, I want to draw shapes.  I want to do triangle, quadrilateral, pentagon, hexagon, and then I would do triangle, square, blank, blank, blank.  Got to see a repetition started, right? You could do shapes, you could do symbols.  If you do numbers sometimes though, those can be a little more tricky.  You could do 3  here's one I'm going to do for you and see if you can figure this out.  It's not a real hard one but I'm going to see if you can figure it out. 3, 7, 11, 15, blank, blank.  I'll leave mine and we can figure it out next time.  Okay?  I'll leave mine and then we'll see, because I didn't make it too hard, and we'll start there next time. So when you finish, here's what I would like for you to do.  As you're thinking about the pattern you want to use, you can use anything we've talked about this week, too.  We've talked about prime and composite.  You could start with a prime number and put them in consecutive order, but not start with 2, maybe start with 7 and do 7, 11, 13, and it's a pattern, but it would be prime number pattern, wouldn't it?  You could do something like that.  Yeah?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah, I got, I just didn't get my privacy folder."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Ah, you didn't get your privacy folder.  Student B, you got yours.

Here's another group if you color those in.  One, two, three, four.  One, two, three, four.  So now you're looking at it, not as sixteenths, but one  count with me  two, three, four.

Did I miss anyone?  I missed Student A.  Okay.  Student A, I want you to work with Student S and Student J.  So come up with your partner.

I'm going to have Students C, P, and E, you guys are going to start by playing the games on the floor because what's going to happen is I know that there is a Witzzle Pro today in math so the two other people that would normally be with you playing the games on the computer and getting the lesson with me are going to play their Witzzle Pro.

You don't make a whole."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The one on the right, you don't take eight of them and you don't make a whole?  Is that what you're talking about? What do you mean by that?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Well, for that one, you group the eights into one whole."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Oh, so this technically is my eight eighths which really equals that one whole.  You grouped the eight eighths together and then what?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "And then the three eighths is adding  well, you added three eighths to the eight eighths to get it."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay.  Why do we call this an improper fraction again?  Why is it called improper?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "It's because the higher number is on the top."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay, the greater number is on the top.  What does this top number mean again?  What is the top number mean?  What is it called, first of all?  When you were writing about this, you wouldn't use top number probably.

Instead of top number, you would call it a what?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "It's stands for how many pieces."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It's talking about how many pieces you're talking about or sometimes it can be how many pieces you're not talking about too because we could talk about the part that we don't have too.  Okay, so you've got to pay attention to words when you're listening or reading things that people are talking about or situations that people are talking about.  Okay, what again does the denominator  one more thing, one more reminder.

That's all this tells me.  This tells me how many pieces I either have or I don't have.  Okay, so just keep remembering that.  So if that's true, if that's true, what I would love for you to do right now is I would like you to show me seven fourths.  So let's start talking about this one.  Show me seven fourths.  If this is my whole, I want you to show me seven fourths.  Hey.  Go ahead and put it on my desk and then you can come in and  And then you can go ahead and get with Students M and M's group.  Actually, how many people do they already have? Five?  Okay, you can go ahead and get in that group.  Okay, what do you have to do because I don't see seven fourths. I see three fourths because you're probably missing  what do you think you have to do to show me seven fourths?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have to make a group of four fourths and then add three to that.

Student M is going somewhere else.  She's not talking about fourths anymore.  She's going to start talking about something else, isn't she? Hm.  So you three are working together and you actually have the seven fourths.  Look what Student M did.  What did Student M do?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "She used the eights, but two eighths equal one fourth."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Ah, so you said that the same thing as this is really how many eighths?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "What was the question again?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Seven fourths minus four fourths.

I'm confused about what I see here.  I don't know where your answer is.  If I was doing an exemplar, I wouldn't  you have to draw a picture.  I wouldn't see that.  So let me see what's your answer?  What did you come up with?  When you took four fourths from seven fourths, what did you get?  Did you take away four fourths from your seven fourths?

All this number does is tell us how many parts of the whole.  Okay, I'm taking five sixths.  It's like saying apples.  Okay, I have five apples.  I have three apples.  You know you got to tell the people what you have. Five apples minus three apples, I have two apples.  I'm not going to say I have two zeros.  So you don't want to subtract the parts.  All this does is give you information about how many parts the whole is broken into.  How many equal parts.  Yes, sir?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "You could also do this.  Like if you have a finance like that and you know it's big number.  You could say I have five sixths apples and I ate three sixths.  I wouldn't end up with two zeroes.  I would end up with two sixths."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Exactly.  And I love how Student J just said that.  He made a connection.  And if you were doing an exemplar, that would be a great example to show us.  Make it to something real. Put the word apples in there if that's what you're talking. Put the word, whatever you like, candy bar, pizza, whatever it is that you picture as your whole, put it in there.  Make it a story and make it make sense to you. Okay?  Want to talk about different denominators, okay?  I want to get back to the six eighths plus four fourths. Okay, I want to talk about that six eighths plus four fourths.  Tell me a little bit about different denominators."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Different denominators can be the same.  You can multiply them, divide them to where they're the same."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Oh, okay.  So let's talk a little bit more about that and we'll show a little bit more of that."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah, I'm missing one of my tenths."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It's okay.  If we work with tenths, I can give you one because these things are really hard to keep up with, okay?  All right, I'm going to give you a fraction.  It's going to be a proper fraction.  It's going to have a numerator that's less than the denominator.  But let's say you have two thirds and you want to add two fourths. Okay, you have two thirds of one pizza and this pizza is divided into thirds.  Okay?  And then you have another pizza, because I know in my family, we don't like  I'm going to put a story, make a connection.  We don't like the same kind of pizza, Student J, okay?  So you're going to have one box and another box with the same size of a pizza. This pizza is going to be divided into three pieces.  This pizza is going to be divided into two pieces.  And let's say I have two out of the three pieces left because only one person was able to eat one piece out of this one.  And let's say I have two fourths of this pizza left and only two people were able to eat it.  But I want to put it into a box. Could you show me with your tiles  okay, first we'll not use the words.  Just show me with the pictures or the tiles or the manipulatives.  Show me two thirds plus two fourths, okay? I like what I'm seeing here.  I'm seeing someone putting two thirds and two fourths together.  So they've got two orange thirds and two yellow fourths.  And they kind of  this one, Student J, he's got his whole over here.  So he's kind of making a connection. Is it going to be easy?  Can I use yours?  Is it easy to see if you just took these and  is that easy to see your answer like that?  Oops.  Can you tell if you put them together?  What do we need to do to the thirds and the fourths to be able to put them together and get something that is going to be reasonable to us or easy for us to see?  What do we need to do to these pizzas?  This one is divided into three pieces. This one is divided into four pieces.  What do we need to do?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Can I do it on the board?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Absolutely.  Do you want to use the marker?  Okay.  What's he going to do, guys?  What do you think he's going to do? Oh, so he's taking that two fourths and he's multiplying it by three over three.  I want to stop you after you do this, okay?  What I want you to do right now is I want you to take your two fourths, guys, and I want you to show me what two fourths would look like if you multiplied it by three over three to get six twelfths.  So go ahead and show me what that two fourths would look like, okay?  You don't have three thirds.  You only have two thirds.  You're taking those two fourths and I want you to show me what that would look like.  He multiplied it by three over three and he ended up with six twelfths.  So use your tiles to show me what the two fourths.  Keep your threes alone. Leave your thirds alone.  Leave your thirds alone, Student J.  I need to see what two fourths would look like.  Okay?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "We were battling back and forth.  Like he would get the card and then I would get the card and then we would be tied up and then he would get a card.

How many twelfths equals one fourth?  What did we do?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Because you have to try to get 12 in both of them because if you do 2 times 3 and 3 times 3, you'll get 9 and 6.

Use a picture because you know on your exemplars you can't just show me in words.  You gotta use pictures too. Okay, so how  okay, so Student J, how many twelfths do we have if we have six twelfths which is the same thing as two fourths and we have how many twelfths?  Eight twelfths which is the same thing as two thirds.  If I were to count each twelfth, how many twelfths would I have altogether?  'Cause when you're adding, you know that's what you're doing.

One person count the yellows, write down the number.  When you went through all the colors, add them, and that would give you your total.  But apparently there seem to be some discourse or there's problems with people counting up the colors because you were arguing over what color you wanted to count.

You have 161, correct?  So now I want you to make your Val and your Tino table, days one through seven, and I want you to see how many that you could probably do and get as close as you can to 161.

You want to go?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "We don't even know what 16 times "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Try that.  Yes, you do.  Have you counted how many you have total?

What?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "You could still use 20."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Well, then you try that and see how that works.

The good news is we might be able to finish this during that time or if there's some time at the end of the day.  I really think, boys and girls, honestly at this point  please look at me and listen.  I don't feel comfortable letting you eat those because, well, I've watched some of you touch your pencils and then touch the candy and touch a white board and then touch the candy.

I would like for this group to roll up your candies because you've counted.  Keep your paperwork.  You don't need the candy anymore, okay?

So don't ask me, I don't get it.  What are dimensions?  Dimensions are the length, width, and height of your actual cube, your actual rectangular prism.  What we're going to do today is explore with boxes, okay?  We're going to explore with boxes.  So what I'm going to do is let you work with a partner, and I'm going to give you three different sets of some cubes.  You're going to get your first set that looks like this.  What do you think you're going to have to do?  Okay.  First you're going to have to do what?  Cut it out, then you're going to have to fold it.  So I have tape at each of the tables, and you and your partner work together.  There are three different cubes.  Cube A, cube B, cube C.  You're going to work with a partner and cut out the patterns for the open cubes.  Fold up the sides, tape them together, okay?  That's step one.

Did you measure the length, the width, or the height?  Okay.  Here is a great kind of predictor for you, to know where you should be at this time.  You have about 5 more minutes, maybe 7 max to be able to get these together.  That means some of you need to stop talking as much as you are.

We were given the whole like the 15 crayons is the whole, and then we were given the fraction and when we look at the denominator, we know how many groups to divide that number into, right? But now we're kind of working backwards.  We don't have the whole. What we know is that he gave a third of the cookies to his sister, but that that one third was two cookies.  So if this is  if you are to make three groups, you might start out by just taking three counters to represent the group, to represent one third.  He gave his sister two cookies.

Got it?  Go ahead and get started.  I'll show you.  It will kind of look like a U, but it's okay.  He doesn't care what a V is.  You can do a J.  V?  I am and I always do, but I want you to try because my rule is you always have to try it on your own first.  Okay.  Student V, you're asking about a V?  It's going to look a little bit like a U. I'd probably bring it in a little bit to a point like this.  See how I'm kind of making it like that? It makes it look less U like, but you're still staying on the lines.  If it were a U, I wouldn't do this staircase thing.  If you don't have a U or V in your name, you can be working.  You don't have to pay attention.  Student J, for your U, you can just do that.  Student D, I heard you say you're curious about a D.  Okay.  D is going to look a little bit like an O, but what I would probably do to make it look a little bit different is kind of give it a tail like that.  It looks a little more like a D and less like an O.  My friends, this is the second time saying this.  If this letter is not in your name, you need to be working.
